x86-Calculator
==============

A basic x86 calculator

The calculator needs to perform the following 5 operations
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction(-)
- Multiplication(*)
- Division(/)
- Modulo (%)

I implemented it as a Finite State Machine so that it only accepts the input in the following way:

[val 1][operator][val 2]

for example

123+456

1*2

-2/2
