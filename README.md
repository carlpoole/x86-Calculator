x86-Calculator
==============

A basic x86 calculator I am making for my CIS341 class

The calculator needs to perform the following 5 operations
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction(-)
- Multiplication(*)
- Division(/)
- Modulo (%)

I implemented it as a Finite State Machine so that it only accepts the input in the following way:

[val 1][space][operator][space][val 2]

for example

123 + 456
1 * 2
-2 / 2
